Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. 
Find these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
smallest positive missing number is 2.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findTwoElement() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an array of integers of size 2 denoting the answer ( The first index contains B and second index contains A.)

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Solution:

def findTwoElement( arr, n): 
      l = []
      for i in range(n):
          if arr[abs(arr[i])-1] > 0:
              arr[abs(arr[i])-1] = -arr[abs(arr[i])-1]
          else:
              l.append(abs(arr[i]))

      for i in range(n):
          if arr[i]>0:
              l.append(i+1)


      return l
    
print(findTwoElement( [1,3,3], 3))
